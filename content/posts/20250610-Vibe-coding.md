## summary: "A new way of coding is emerging where AI writes most of the code and humans just guide the process — meet vibe coding."

Vibe coding is a buzzworthy approach to software development where developers (and even non-developers) describe what they want in natural language, and a Large Language Model (LLM) generates the code. Instead of meticulously crafting every line, humans focus on testing, tweaking, and guiding the AI’s output—letting the “vibes” steer the process.

## Where It Came From

The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy, former Tesla AI lead and co-founder of OpenAI, in early 2025. Karpathy described it as *“fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists.”* The goal is to shift coding from syntax-wrangling to idea-realisation.

## How It Works

1. Describe the task or goal in plain language.
2. Let the AI generate a code implementation.
3. Test the result and provide feedback.
4. Iterate until it works as intended.

This process resembles pair-programming with a very fast, very literal partner—one who doesn’t get tired, but can also misunderstand instructions spectacularly.

## Who’s Using It

- Hobbyists building quick prototypes.
- Startups in early stages, with Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch reporting some codebases being 95% AI-generated.
- Developers looking to rapidly experiment with features or architectures.

## Benefits and Risks

| Benefits | Risks |
|----------|-------|
| Rapid prototyping | Harder to understand underlying code |
| Lower barrier to entry | Potential hidden bugs and security flaws |
| Creative freedom | Maintenance can be challenging |

Experts caution against shipping vibe-coded software to production without thorough human review and testing.

## Why It Matters

Vibe coding hints at a future where programming becomes more about creativity and less about syntax. It could democratise software creation, making it accessible to anyone with ideas. But it also raises questions: Who’s responsible for AI-generated mistakes? How do we ensure long-term maintainability?

Like many tech trends, vibe coding is both exciting and risky. Whether it becomes the new normal or remains a niche approach will depend on how we balance speed, creativity, and quality.
