Voice assistants are becoming more than gadgets in 2020 — they’re tools for everyday problem-solving. Over a weekend I built a quick Alexa skill, called *Care*, to see how voice and serverless tech could handle routine customer-care tasks.  

The demo shows Alexa resuming a TV subscription, switching billing to email, and even scheduling a call with a human agent when needed. All of it runs on **AWS Lambda**, meaning no servers to manage and easy scaling.
