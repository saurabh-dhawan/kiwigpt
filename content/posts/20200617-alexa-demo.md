In mid-2020 I built a quick demo of an **Alexa Skill** using Amazon’s **AWS Lambda** serverless platform. At the time, voice assistants were moving from novelty to everyday tools, and I wanted to see how far a weekend hack could go.  

The result was a customer-care skill called *Care*. It could resume a TV subscription, switch billing preferences from paper to email, and even escalate a tricky request to a human agent when Alexa hit its limits. Everything ran on **Lambda**, which meant no servers to manage — the code only ran when invoked and scaled automatically0.

## What the demo showed

- **Account management**: Alexa recognised a request to resume TV service, confirmed the subscription, and updated billing.  
- **Billing preferences**: It suggested switching to email invoices to cut paper waste and carbon emissions — a small but clear sustainability nudge.  
- **Escalation**: For anything outside its scope, Alexa scheduled a call back from a real person to the customer’s registered number.  

These are the kinds of repetitive, low-complexity tasks that intelligent virtual assistants are well suited for — available *24/7* and able to reduce support load1.

## Why this mattered

The demo was rough around the edges, but it showed how easily conversational flows could be prototyped. Voice AI was already gaining mainstream adoption by 2020, with analysts noting how the pandemic accelerated use of digital assistants in everyday life2.  

Serverless made this kind of tinkering cost-effective: you only pay for execution time, not idle servers. For enterprises, the same principles apply at scale — automate the routine, confirm actions clearly, and always leave a path to human help.
