Right now, we’re somewhere on the curve — maybe climbing towards a high, maybe coasting down the other side. Either way, the wave keeps moving.  

Life’s a sine wave — gentle rises, soft falls, and all the in-between stretches we barely notice.  

The highs feel brilliant, but they don’t last. The lows can feel endless, but they pass too.  

Most of our days happen between those extremes — in the quiet climbs, steady plateaus, and slow descents.  

When we take a step back, the noise fades. We can see the pattern, and it’s oddly reassuring.  

We can’t stop the wave, but we can ride it together — easing into the highs, steadying through the lows, finding a rhythm that feels right.  

When we remember the wave keeps moving, we stop gripping the peak and dreading the drop. We just ride — together. 🙏 Happy Janmashtami
