Enterprise Architecture (EA) has long been about the *big picture*—vision, strategy, and ensuring the technology landscape doesn’t collapse under the weight of its own complexity. Agile, on the other hand, is all about *delivering value fast*, embracing change, and avoiding big upfront designs.

When these two worlds meet… sparks fly.

## Agile vs EA — The Friendly (Mostly) Tension

**From Agile’s perspective**:  
- “Why are we waiting for an architecture review when customers want this feature yesterday?”  
- “We value working software over comprehensive documentation… remember?”

**From EA’s perspective**:  
- “If we don’t think ahead, you’ll ship three incompatible solutions that all do the same thing—badly.”  
- “We value sustainable systems over short-term wins… remember?”

Neither side is wrong. The tension exists because both are optimising for different *time horizons*. Agile looks at *now*; EA looks at *years from now*. And in a complex organisation, both timelines matter.

## The AI Twist

Enter AI, and the game changes:

- Agile teams can **prototype AI features fast**—but need guidance on how to integrate them responsibly.  
- EA can **map AI capabilities to enterprise strategy**—but needs to move at AI’s breakneck speed.  
- Data governance, model lifecycles, and compliance frameworks become *must-haves*, not nice-to-haves.

Suddenly, the EA’s obsession with *guardrails* starts to look… less like bureaucracy and more like survival planning.

## Unresolved Questions

- Can Agile teams stay truly autonomous if AI ethics and governance require central oversight?  
- Can EA adapt its processes to keep up with AI’s rapid evolution without sacrificing rigor?  
- Will “just enough architecture” work when the AI components themselves are changing weekly?  

The answers aren’t fully clear—yet.

## My Completely Biased Conclusion

If AI continues accelerating the pace of change, **context, coherence, and guardrails** will become even more important.  
And who are the keepers of that? Enterprise Architects.  

So perhaps in the not-so-distant future, delivery teams will be saying:  
> “We value *comprehensive architecture over working software*—at least until the architecture is perfect.”  

(*Note: This conclusion may be slightly biased. Written by someone who is, in fact, an Enterprise Architect.*)

In the age of Agile and AI, EA isn’t dead—it’s evolving. And if you ask an EA, it’s evolving to become the *only* role that truly matters. 😉
