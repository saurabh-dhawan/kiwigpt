**Relatively short post today.**

I came across this amazing tool called [Transformer Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/). It lets you see how a Transformer model (like GPT-2) actually works, layer by layer, right in your browser. You can watch tokens flow through embeddings, self-attention, and MLPs, and even play around with parameters like temperature and top-k to see how text generation changes.
