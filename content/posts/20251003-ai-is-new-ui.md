## TL;DR
- AI is becoming the front door to software: instead of clicking, you ask.  
- Agents (like those built on [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)) go further, skipping native UIs to act on your behalf.  
- But not everything should be replaced: old UIs remain best for precision, safety, and learning.  
- For Kiwi companies (Trade Me, Xero, One NZ), the challenge is balancing AI’s magic with trust, transparency, and compliance.

## 1. Language as the new input

Once, we memorised commands. Then we clicked icons. Now, increasingly, we just talk.  

Satya Nadella called human language “the new UI” back in [2016](https://news.microsoft.com/speeches/satya-nadella-and-terry-myerson-build-2016/). The phrase **“AI is the new UI”** has since been echoed by business leaders like [Terry Jones](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnsviokla/2024/11/20/ai-is-the-new-ui-3-steps-business-leaders-must-take-now/).  

Everyday examples show the shift:  
- **Microsoft Copilot** lets you type “Summarise this email thread and suggest a reply” without navigating menus ([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview)).  
- **Spotify DJ** curates music by conversation instead of endless scroll ([launch](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/)).  
- Locally, **Xero** could easily imagine “File GST for last quarter” as a natural command, or **Trade Me**: “List this couch for $100, write a better description, and suggest delivery options.”  

This doesn’t kill UI — it just **re-centres it around intent**. Buttons still matter for detailed control, but the front door is increasingly conversational.

## 2. Agents as the new UI

Language gets you partway. Agents take you further.  

Instead of just answering, an **agent acts**. They orchestrate tools, call APIs, and return results — all without you touching a screen. Salesforce calls this the rise of “agents as the interface” ([Salesforce, 2025](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-agents-user-interface/)).  

The underlying tech: **protocols like MCP**. These standardise how AI systems access calendars, files, or customer records in a safe, permissioned way ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)). It’s like giving your assistant a swipe card: they can only open the doors you authorise.  

For Kiwi businesses:  
- **One NZ** could let a customer simply say: “Upgrade me to the latest iPhone plan and transfer my number.” The agent checks stock, runs the order, updates billing.  
- **Trade Me** could let sellers ask: “Re-list unsold items with a 10% discount.” The agent edits and posts, logging every change.  
- **Xero** could expose invoice tools to an AI layer — your request flows straight into the accounting engine, with audit trails for compliance.  

This flips design priorities. Instead of screen flows, product teams now define:  
- **Intents**: what tasks should the AI handle?  
- **Guardrails**: which permissions, approvals, and logs are mandatory?  
- **Transparency**: how do users see what the agent actually did?

## Why this matters

The hype is real, but the nuance matters.  

- AI **removes drudgery**: fewer clicks, fewer swivel-chair moments.  
- Old UIs still **anchor precision**: pixel edits, financial approvals, compliance workflows.  
- For NZ firms, the opportunity is to design hybrid systems: conversational entry, agentic execution, and strong visible controls.  

The shift won’t erase apps like Xero or Trade Me — it will just make their **APIs and policies the true product surface**. The UI you see may shrink, but the AI in between will expand.
