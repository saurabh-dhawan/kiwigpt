Today I want to talk about **Shadow IT**. Not Shadow AI â€” I'll cover that another day. Shadow IT is those tools and systems folks spin up outside ITâ€™s blessing: sprawling Excel workbooks, legacy Access databases, SaaS apps bought quietly. Theyâ€™re not always reckless â€” most of the time theyâ€™re born from urgency and ingenuity.

I recently heard an anecdote that gives the flavour. A payroll specialist, wrestling with a tedious task, asked if their company could *buy Python*. They had asked Gemini how to solve the problem, and the model suggested Python. Taken at face value, it is a 'lack of context' problem but it also reveals a powerful instinct: people will chase any tool that promises a quick fix, even if they donâ€™t quite know what theyâ€™re asking for. That impulse â€” the creative scramble â€” is the heartbeat of Shadow IT.

## Why Shadow IT Exists

Shadow IT doesnâ€™t emerge from rule-breaking â€” it springs from constraint. IT budgets and attention often vanish into long, broad projects: ERP rollouts, compliance mandates, multi-year digital strategies. Meanwhile, frontline teams in finance, HR or operations face urgent problems. They arenâ€™t being mischievous â€” theyâ€™re just trying to get things done. So they whip up an Access DB, build a monster Excel file, or attach a quick script. Over time, these patch-work tools become mission critical.

From an IT lens these creations look brittle and risky. From the business side, theyâ€™re lifelines.

## The High-Stakes Spreadsheet

Hereâ€™s a real Kiwi example of Shadow IT at scale. **Health New Zealand (HNZ)**, managing roughly a **NZ$28 billion** budget, relies on a single Excel spreadsheet for consolidation and critical reporting.  

A Deloitte review flagged issues including:  

- Hard-coded values that arenâ€™t clearly traceable  
- Mistakes â€” like incorrect accruals or duplicates â€” going unnoticed until later  
- Changes to earlier periods not flowing through properly  
- No reliable auditing of sources  
- Human-error hazards like missing zeros or mistyped numbers  
- Slow turnaround: 12 to 15 days just to consolidate each month  

Yet that one spreadsheet is the core reporting tool for a national health system. This isnâ€™t just a quirk â€” itâ€™s a signal. When formal tools fall short, people innovate. And sometimes those innovations run the show.

## The AI Twist

Shadow IT used to be spreadsheets and Access. Now, it's taking on a new shape â€” AI. But thereâ€™s a twist: many companies are *actively pushing* employees to use AI. Itâ€™s not shadow anymore â€” itâ€™s sanctioned.  

For example:  

- A recent survey found that **nearly seven in ten companies** now use AI at work, with leaders actively encouraging staff to adopt it. ðŸ‘‰ [HR Dive report](https://www.hrdive.com/news/almost-7-in-10-companies-now-use-ai-for-work/747880/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- At **Google**, engineers face an unspoken requirement to show daily AI use, or risk being left behind. ðŸ‘‰ [Business Insider story](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employees-use-ai-or-get-left-behind-gemini-2025-8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

When AI is encouraged â€” or mandated â€” Shadow IT becomes less about hiding and more about shaping. The real question shifts to: *How do we harness that energy without losing control?*

## What to Do (and What This All Means)

- Shadow IT often signals genuine gaps where official IT fails to keep up  
- The Python anecdote isnâ€™t just amusing â€” it shows how people chase solutions, often at the edges of understanding  
- In NZ, lean teams and tight budgets make DIY systems inevitable. That gives us an edge: we can build trust and guide clever fixes before they run wild  
- Once AI is encouraged, strategy must shift from policing to shaping. Itâ€™s about empowerment, governance and support
