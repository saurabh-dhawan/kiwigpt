Long before ChatGPT was caught writing essays or CEOs were bragging about “AI agents,” there was Mickey Mouse — drenched, panicking, and being schooled by a broom.

*Fantasia’s* **“The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”** isn’t just a cartoon. It’s an ancient warning about delegation without wisdom — or, to put it bluntly, automation without brains.

## The Old Story, Fresh Eyes 👀

Picture it. The workshop hums with quiet power. The old sorcerer steps out, leaving his apprentice, Mickey, with one boring task: fetch water. Mickey looks at the heavy buckets, looks at the spellbook, and has a brilliant idea — “Why not get the broom to do it?”

It works. For a while.

The broom plods back and forth, splashing buckets into the tub. Mickey lounges like a genius — until the broom keeps going. And going. The room floods. Mickey panics, grabs an axe, splits the broom.  
Big mistake. Now there are *two* brooms.  
Then four. Then eight. Water everywhere.

Finally, the sorcerer returns, waves his hand, and restores order. The apprentice stares, soggy and ashamed. Moral of the story? **Don’t mess with forces you don’t fully understand.**

Here’s the scene itself, in glorious chaos:

## The Broom Isn’t the Problem 🧹

Now, here’s the twist:  
The broom didn’t do anything *wrong*. It did exactly what it was told.

The real issue? Mickey.

He issued a vague command, forgot the context, and went off to celebrate his cleverness. He wanted magic to replace understanding. Sound familiar?

That’s the modern *agentic AI* dilemma in a nutshell. These systems are obedient, fast, and eerily literal. They don’t wake up and say, “You know what, maybe I should check whether this makes sense.” They just execute.  

They carry out *your* intention — as written, not as meant.

So when things go wrong, it’s not the broom’s fault. It’s the apprentice who forgot to think like a master.

## Why This Hits So Close to Home

We’re doing the same thing every day — only with code instead of spells.

We automate emails, decisions, logistics, investments. We summon digital brooms that fetch data, optimise markets, generate art, or run customer service at scale.  
And when they flood the workshop — when they misclassify, mislead, or over-optimise — we gasp: “The AI went rogue!”

No, mate. We went lazy.

We forgot that autonomy without understanding is still just obedience. And that control isn’t built by accident — it’s designed.

## The Real Lesson 🧠

Disney wasn’t warning us about technology. He was warning us about *ourselves*.

Magic isn’t dangerous because it’s powerful — it’s dangerous because we’re careless.  
Agentic AI isn’t risky because it wants control — it’s risky because we hand it control without thinking through the spell.

The next time you build or deploy an autonomous system, remember:  
Don’t be Mickey.  
Don’t hand your broom the bucket and walk away.  
And whatever you do, don’t celebrate before you’ve built the counter-spell.

Or in business terms:  
**Don’t play Mickey with your systems. Build like the sorcerer — calm, prepared, and ready for the flood.**

Magic’s easy. Mastery’s the hard part.  
And the broom? It’s still waiting for orders.
