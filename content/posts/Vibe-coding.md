# Vibe Coding: The Rise of AI-Driven Programming by Feel

> A cutting-edge and slightly controversial coding paradigm where developers let AI take the wheel—guided by *vibes*.

---

##  Summary

**Vibe coding** is a buzzworthy software development approach where developers describe a project or task in natural language and let a Large Language Model (LLM) generate the code. The human role shifts toward iterative testing and feedback rather than writing code line-by-line. Introduced by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, it exemplifies how AI can let even non-programmers bring ideas to life—albeit with some notable caveats.

##  Background

- **Coined by**: Andrej Karpathy — former Tesla AI leader and co-founder of OpenAI 2  
- **How it works**: Developers provide tasks and examples; the LLM writes code; developers test and refine through feedback loops 3  
- Karpathy described it as “fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists.” 4

##  Adoption & Use Cases

- Used by **non-programmers and amateurs** to prototype tools and apps quickly 5  
- **Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 cohort**: 25% of startups report codebases that are 95% AI-generated 6  
- Coverage in publications like *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal* indicates growing commercial interest 7

##  Pros & Cons

|  Advantages                            |  Risks & Challenges                                      |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Speeds up prototyping and iteration     | Developers may lack understanding of the generated code   |
| Lowers barrier for entry into coding    | Potential for hidden bugs and security vulnerabilities    |
| Accelerates concept-to-code workflows   | Maintenance and debugging can be difficult                |

Experts warn against deploying vibe-coded software in production without thorough review and testing 8.

##  Implications for the Future of Development

- Could democratize software creation—framing coding as a creative dialogue with AI  
- Raises questions about accountability and code quality in professional environments  
- Suggests a shift in developer roles—from manual builders to AI guides and auditors
