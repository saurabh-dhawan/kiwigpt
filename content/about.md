description: "About KiwiGPT – where curiosity meets code, AI, and the occasional half-built experiment."
---

Kia ora! I’m Saurabh Dhawan, the human behind **KiwiGPT** – a place where curiosity collides with technology, and experiments are as likely to be half-built as they are finished.  

I live in Aotearoa New Zealand and spend my time exploring the edges of **AI, machine learning, and software architecture**, often blending them with real-world problem-solving. Some of my projects ship polished and shiny. Others… well, let’s just say they teach me something along the way (and sometimes become future posts here).  

## What You'll Find Here

- Deep dives into **AI trends**, coding experiments, and how emerging tech actually works.
- Hands-on Raspberry Pi builds, prototypes, and playful side projects.
- Reflections on **learning, philosophy, and the human side of technology**.
- Occasional left-field ideas – because not everything needs a business case to exist.

## My Approach

I treat this site like a workshop you can walk through: some benches have finished creations, some have sawdust and open schematics.  
That’s the beauty of it – technology (and life) is always in beta.  

If you’re into **AI, inventive tinkering, and learning out loud**, you’ll feel right at home here.  
And if you like your ideas served with a mix of seriousness and humour – even better.

**P.S.** Not every experiment here will work. That’s the point.
